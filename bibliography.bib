  abstract  = {Serverless computing is increasingly popular because of the promise of lower cost and the convenience it provides to users who do not need to focus on server management. This has resulted in the availability of a number of proprietary and open-source serverless solutions. We seek to understand how the performance of serverless computing depends on a number of design issues using several popular open-source serverless platforms. We identify the idiosyncrasies affecting performance (throughput and latency) for different open-source serverless platforms. Further, we observe that just having either resource-based (CPU and memory) or workload-based (request per second (RPS) or concurrent requests) auto-scaling is inadequate to address the needs of the serverless platforms.},

  edition   = {1st},
  abstract  = {Summary In Single Page Web Applications you'll learn to build modern browser-based apps that take advantage of stronger client platforms and more predictable bandwidth. You'll learn the SPA design approach, and then start exploring new techniques like structured JavaScript and responsive design. And you'll learn how to capitalize on trends like server-side JavaScript and NoSQL data stores, as well as new frameworks that make JavaScript more manageable and testable as a first-class language. About this Book If your website is a jumpy collection of linked pages, you are behind. Single page web applications are your next step: pushing UI rendering and business logic to the browser and communicating with the server only to synchronize data, they provide a smooth user experience, much like a native application. But, SPAs can be hard to develop, manage, and test. Single Page Web Applications shows how your team can easily design, test, maintain, and extend sophisticated SPAs using JavaScript end-to-end, without getting locked into a framework. Along the way, you'll develop advanced HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript skills, and use JavaScript as the language of the web server and the database. This book assumes basic knowledge of web development. No experience with SPAs is required. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. What's InsideDesign, build, and test a full-stack SPA Best-in-class tools like jQuery, TaffyDB, Node.js, and MongoDB Real-time web with web sockets and Socket.IO Touch controls for tablets and smartphones Common SPA design mistakesAbout the Authors The authors are architects and engineering managers. Michael Mikowski has worked on many commercial SPAs and a platform that processes over 100 billion requests per year. Josh Powell has built some of the most heavily trafficked sites on the web.

Promised reduction in operational and development costs attracts not only startups but also enterprise clients despite that serverless is a relatively fresh field where new patterns and services continue to emerge. Serverless started as independent services which solve specific problems (highly scalable storage and computing), and now it's become a paradigm shift how systems are built. This thesis addressed questions when and how to start with serverless by reviewing available literature, conducting interviews with IT professionals, analyzing available tools, identifying limitations of serverless architecture and providing checklist when serverless is applicable. The focus was on AWS serverless stack, but main findings are generic and hold for all serverless providers serverless delivers what it promises, however, the devil is in the detail. Providers are continuously working to resolve limitations or building new services as solutions in order to make serverless the next phase of cloud evolution. },

  abstract  = {Amazon Web Services unveiled their "Lambda" platform in late 2014. Since then, each of the major cloud computing infrastructure providers has released services supporting a similar style of deployment and operation, where rather than deploying and running monolithic services, or dedicated virtual machines, users are able to deploy individual functions, and pay only for the time that their code is actually executing. These technologies are gathered together under the marketing term "serverless" and the providers suggest that they have the potential to significantly change how client/server applications are designed, developed and operated. This paper presents two case industrial studies of early adopters, showing how migrating an application to the Lambda deployment architecture reduced hosting costs - by between 66% and 95% - and discusses how further adoption of this trend might influence common software architecture design practices.},
